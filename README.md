# üß† Task Manager API

A lightweight and RESTful Django-based API to manage tasks, inspired by Unix-like process handling. It allows users to list, create, delete, and fork (duplicate) tasks easily.

## üìå Project Overview

This API mimics Unix's `fork()` system call by allowing tasks to be "forked"‚Äîcreating a copy of an existing task. It supports the following features:

- List all tasks
- Create a new task
- Fetch task details by ID
- Delete a task by ID
- Fork (duplicate) a task by ID
